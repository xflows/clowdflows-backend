    """Computes a topological sorting of a directed graph.

    The topological sorting is an ordering of the graph's nodes such that,
    for every edge (u -> v), u comes before v.
    The implementation is hardened against loops and arbitrary cycles and
    can handle isolated nodes and complete (sub)graphs. In these
    degenerated cases the computed ordering is obviously not correct
    (as there is no correct one), but it will contain all nodes and the nodes
    not participating in cycles will be ordered correctly.
    The detected cycles can be reported, but it is not guaranteed that every
    cycle is reported (this does not mean a cycle can ever go undetected).
    Note that the node objects must be hashable and properly compare by
    identity with the ``is`` operator.
    
    The basic algorithm is a depth-first search along the reversed
    edges, starting from nodes that only have incoming edges.
    With this kind of traversal, the result ordering is added to whenever
    a recursion frame ends.
    Additionally we employ cycle detection by tracking which nodes have
    already been visited *within the same recursion tree path*.
    This mechanism can both detect cycles and determine the participating
    nodes. To do this robustly and not run into infinite recursion we globally
    track which edges have been traversed so far and skip those later.

    Args:
        * edges: the directed edges of the graph (an iterable of iterables).
          The first two elements of each edges element are interpreted as
          directed edge (1st elem -> 2nd elem).
        * extra_nodes: if specified, an iterable with any additional (or
          duplicated) nodes. This is entirely optional and this sequence does
          not have to include all or any nodes specified in the edges,
          but if used, this function can include in the sorting those nodes
          without incoming or outgoing edges (i.e., isolated nodes,
          with nodes of degree 2 with a loop also considered isolated).
        * non_loop_cycles_are_errors: if specified and True, non-loop cycles are
          detected and a CycleDetectedError is raised. Normally, edges
          completing a cycle in a traveral are ignored,
          Since there exists no topological ordering for a graph with cyles
          the returning sequence is not correct, but it will contain all nodes
          and it will be correct for the nodes that do not make up cycles.
          Note that this argument has no effect on the handling of loops which
          are ignored by default.
        * loops_are_errors: if specified and True, loops are detected
          and a LoopDetectedError is raised. Normally, loops are ignored.
        * loop_report: if specified this argument should be a list that any
          detected nodes with loops are appended to.
        * cycle_report: if specified this argument should be a list that any
          detected cycles are appended to (as a list of nodes for each cycle).
          Note that there is no guarantee that all cycles in the graph will be
          reported.

    Returns:
        A list of all nodes in topological order or, if no such order exists,
        one that comes reasonably close.

    Raises:
        * LoopDetectedError: if loops_are_errors is True and a loop is detected.
          If the loop_report argument was specified and this exception is
          raised, the report will contain the loop.
        * CycleDetectedError: if non_loop_cycles_are_errors is True and a
          cycle is detected. If the cycle_report argument was specified and
          this exception is raised, the report will contain the cycle.
